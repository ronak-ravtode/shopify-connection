    "rejected" is NOT "has an AWB but no SS- id". Both push paths
    (register_tracking and POST /shipments/push) persist shipsagar_tracking_id
    as SS-{awb} BEFORE reading the provider's verdict, so an accepted push and a
    refusal leave byte-identical columns; only the SHIPSAGAR_PUSH_REJECTED audit
    row separates them. Inverting the test the other way round would report every
    manually created shipment (create_shipment / book, which never contacts
    ShipSagar and leaves the column NULL) as refused.

    So: no tracking number, or no provider id, means ShipSagar does not have it
    yet and the shipment is awaiting. SS-STUB-* is a local placeholder written
    when credentials are absent - it is not a provider reference, even though it
    does start with "SS-".

    "awaiting" means "no tracking number yet" and nothing more. It does NOT mean
    the shipment can be pushed: carrier_code="MANUAL" also lands here, because
    that shipment has a tracking number but was never sent anywhere, and
    register_tracking refuses MANUAL as a courier (NON_COURIER_CODES), so pushing
    it would always 400. The frontend must gate the Add Shipment action on
    carrier_code, not on push_state. A fifth value such as "manual" was
    considered and rejected: it would push a carrier-code detail into the state
    machine, and carrier_code is already on the payload for exactly this decision.

    An awaiting shipment carries a placeholder AWB rather than an empty one -
    shipments is UNIQUE(business_id, carrier_code, awb_number), so an empty AWB
    capped a tenant at one awaiting shipment. is_awaiting_awb covers the
    placeholder and the empty string, so this test is unchanged in meaning.
