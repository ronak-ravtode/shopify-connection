# SHIPSAGAR_EMAIL and SHIPSAGAR_COMPANY constants. pydantic-settings resolves
# env_file entries against the current working directory, so the previous
# cwd-relative list read backend/.env only when launched from backend/ and
# missed it entirely when launched from the repo root - every ShipSagar call
# then failed with SHIPSAGAR_NOT_CONFIGURED. Absolute paths make the start
# directory irrelevant. In a list the later file wins, so backend/.env takes
# precedence over the shared root file.
